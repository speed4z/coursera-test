        Beef</p>
        Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts,
         short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.),
        while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older
        , leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages.
          The blood is used in some varieties called blood sausage.</div>

        Chicken</p>
        For the culinary use of chickens, see Chicken as food. For other uses, see Chicken and Chooks (disambiguation).
        The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus).
         Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, 
         up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl. 
         Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets.</div>
